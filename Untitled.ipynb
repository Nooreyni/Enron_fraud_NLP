      "\n",
      "ENA:  ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of \n",
      "manager and above.  I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.  Lavorato has \n",
      "placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement \n",
      "of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of \n",
      "manager or above.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).\n",
      "\n",
      "Net Works:  Net Works has hired over 800 employees and contractors in 2000.  \n",
      "I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be \n",
      "managed out.  Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling \n",
      "and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to  ensure \n",
      "that risks are managed in that situation.  I have seen improvement in that \n",
      "group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it \n",
      "may improve over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contractors are another issue at Net Works.  A significant portion of the \n",
      "work force is contract personnel.  Microsoft issues could arise if \n",
      "contractors are allowed to stay on too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.  Net Works has too many \n",
      "employees in the \"exempt\" category who should be classified as \"non-exempt.\"  \n",
      "I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.  It will \n",
      "not be an easy fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "EIM:  The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of \n",
      "talent as well as M&A activity.  HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle \n",
      "diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle \n",
      "the job.  \n",
      "\n",
      "EGM:  EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other \n",
      "groups within Wholesale.  That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make \n",
      "retention of key personnel essential.  I expect to see continued pressure to \n",

      "\n",
      "Logistics.  The most significant area for the employee matters involves the \n",
      "logistics of the buyer hiring the employees.  In the original agreement that \n",
      "we proposed, we would allow the buyer to interview employees, select the ones \n",
      "they wanted to hire, and require that the buyer keep them employed for at \n",
      "least 2 years.  Their counter proposal was that they got to hire who they \n",
      "wanted, have us pay severance on all others, and they would have no \n",
      "obligation to keep them for any length of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, there have been discussions internally that we want all employees \n",
      "to go with the sale, with the buyer taking the action of severing employees \n",
      "(although we would fund severance costs under the Enron formula).  I raised \n",
      "that proposal with Nancy, who is going to discuss it with her business \n",
      "clients.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the alternative, if the buyer selects the people it hires, and we have to \n",

      "require an indemnity for claims made against us based on the selection \n",
      "process.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Base Salary.  The counteroffer made by Bidder D does not provide that the \n",
      "employees hired from HPL would receive at least the same base salary as they \n",
      "earn at Enron.  This is important because a severance payment could be due if \n",
      "an employee does not accept a job at a lower salary.  Karen appeared \n",
      "unwilling to agree to pay divested employees outside of the buyer's salary \n",
      "bands (note:  paying outside of a salary band in the context of an \n",
      "acquisition is standard procedure, but she was acting as if it were an \n",
      "incredibly difficult accomplishment).  She claimed that one problem lies in \n",
      "not knowing the exact salary for each employee at issue.  We pushed back on \n",
      "this and offered to provide average salaries for each job level, to allow her \n",
      "to get comfortable with the ranges.  Fran Mayes will provide this \n",
      "information, which may eliminate this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonus.  In our proposal, we asked that the hired employees receive a total \n",
      "bonus payment that is at least equal to what they earned their last year at \n",
      "Enron.  Bidder D did not provide any such guarantee.  Karen said that she \n",
      "needed our \"bonus formula\" before she could commit to this.  I explained that \n",
      "we have no bonus formula and that our bonuses are based on performance of the \n",
      "company and the individual.  We previously had provided total bonus amounts \n",
      "for the entire group, and she could make a determination of bonus costs on a \n",
      "consolidated basis for her deal folks to calculate.  j\n",
      "\n",
      "She said she was \"not sure if they could get there\" on the bonus issue, \n",
      "particularly since she thinks our bonuses will be extra high this year.  I \n",
      "offered to discuss whether we could modify the amounts by averaging the last \n",
      "two years, which she thought might make it better.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Unvested Equity.  When I explained to her that we could not supervest \n",
      "unvested options, she indicated that there was a \"possibility\" that the \n",
      "amount could be made up in stock options of Bidder D.  I think this is the \n",
      "\"win-win\" position, but I think it will have to be pushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vacation.  Their vacation plan maxes out at 4 weeks; ours maxes out at 5 \n",
      "weeks.  She thinks she may be able to propose that, for the first year the \n",
      "employees work for the buyer, they can use the vacation accrual from Enron, \n",
      "but after that, they are subject to the buyer's vacation plan.  This approach \n",
      "is reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "WARN Act.  There is the slight possibility of WARN Act implications, in the \n",
      "unlikely event that closing occurs within 60 days of signing.  The WARN  Act \n",
      "requires a company to give employees 60 days notice of a plant closing or \n",
      "mass layoff.  This situation probably would qualify.  Thus, we would have to \n",
      "give 60 days notice to all employees who potentially may be affected.  We can \n",
      "pay in lieu of notice, in the event that the closing (and thus the \n",
      "terminations) occur sooner than 60 days after closing, but we may want to \n",
      "spell out who bears that cost, if it is incurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits.  Other than the vacation benefit described above, it appears that \n",
      "Bidder D has benefits that generally are of the same nature as Enron's \n",
      "benefits.  Thus, allowing the hired employees to participate in the buyer's \n",

      "SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Primary grades of North American market pulp declined last week as producers waited for their proactive downtime plans to take effect and many buyers easily talked down prices. Benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) fell another 4 percent, dropping $20/tonne to $480/tonne while other grades declined even further. \n",
      "Although many producers are moving to align supplies with moderate demand conditions, various sources said that softwood pulps in particular were still too abundant in the U.S and Canada. But over the short to middle term, market watchers appear less concerned with inventory levels and indicated that a cyclical bottom was very close. \n",
      "Some producer sources suggested that downward pressure had eased compared to last month. However, several buyers noted they had easily pushed down prices for most pulp grades. Effective list prices for southern bleached softwood kraft slipped $30/tonne to $430-$440/tonne on oversupply. But differential prices showed a slight anomaly as northern bleached hardwood kraft dipped only $10/tonne to $420-$440/tonne as the grade was said to be less abundant on the contract market. Suppliers also claimed its specialty uses allowed it to hold up compared to other grades. But southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) prices saw the month's largest percentage drop, down 7 percent or $30/tonne to $390-$410/tonne. Still, market participants appear to be looking to the near term future with guarded optimism. \n",
      "Tuesday's North American/Scandinavian (Norscan) chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventory report may have been the first sign that producers have been able to control their stocks this year. Norscan inventories rose only 5,000 tonnes in July, well off an average July increase of 143,500 tonnes recorded over the past 10 years. \n",
      "Norscan stocks stood at 1.785 million tonnes at the end of July, representing 32 days of supply. Producers also held 32 days of supply in June. July inventories closed at 42.3 percent higher than year-ago results, a large improvement over the prior month's year over year 66.9 percent differential. \n",
      "\"When you consider the downtime and how much production is being taken out of the market in the next three months, it's quite staggering,\" said a U.S.-based agent. \"Also, look at Asian and European buyers who are building inventories in anticipation of a bottom. There are some fundamental and psychological changes in the market (that will occur) in the next month as inventories are announced and downtime continues.\" \n",
      "Guaranteed pricing offers. Both pulp sellers and buyers indicated there have recently been more attempts at guaranteed prices for anywhere from two to five months. A U.S.-based producer source said some buyers had proposed guaranteed prices for their contracted tonnes through the end of the year on concern of a sudden price rebound. \n",
      "Export markets showed mixed results. European prices again slid while Asian markets such as China and Korea appeared to level off. Consumer downtime continues to hit suppliers, but an Asian buyer said downtime at his firm's paper mills averaging a week per month were tempered by already low pulp prices. Hardwood pulps also appear to have leveled off there despite continued aggressive maneuvering from Brazilian producers that over the past few months have adjusted their prices to compete with Indonesian and other suppliers. \n",
      "In U.S. spot markets, NBSK pulp prices recently declined just over 2 percent compared to recent weeks, and apparently have come to mirror contract prices in non-Japan Asia. \n",
      "\"NBSK spot prices seem to have bottomed out. List and spot prices are converging, which has always (signaled) a bottom,\" said Gordon Floe of NLK Consultants, who suggested that NBSK spot prices in the U.S. had already bottomed at $400/tonne weeks ago. \"But there is still a lot of pain for the producers in contract tonnage. Contract and spot needs to converge before a recovery will happen.\" \n",
      "Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest declined $10/tonne to $410-$440/tonne last week on paperloop's spot market price index. Recent paperloop spot prices represent a middle range of transactions, and closed 11.5 percent below August contract prices.\n",

      "GISB IS NOW NAESB\n",
      "GISB is now officially NAESB.  (The actual pronunciation is still undetermined!!!)  I may unintentionally go back and forth between the names -- my apologies in advance.  Also, some things are still officially 'GISB', such as the operating practices.  There is still transition work to be done.  At times it's a bit confusing and has already come up during a subcommittee meeting.  I'm working to keep up with everything in NAESB, at least for a while, to watch for things that affect our quadrant and our processes.\n",
      "AGA is hosting two meetings in January in Washington, D.C. to discuss the retail gas and retail electric quadrants.\n",
      "Numerous meetings are being held by organizations such as NERC.  These are being held in response to the FERC order issued December 19 (RM01-12), which addresses standards development for the wholesale electric industry.  If the industry does not agree on a single standards development organization for wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002, the FERC will either choose one or develop the standards themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "GISB (NAESB) UPDATE MEETINGS\n",
      "Due to current events at Enron and then the holidays, I haven't held these meetings on a regular basis.  I'm working on a regular schedule of meetings.  People have said they want these to continue and prefer them to written updates.  They want to know what's going on in GISB, including what's happening with NAESB.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOPR ON GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS\n",
      "I'll work with Nancy Bagot on our comments (due February 1).\n",
      "The El Paso pipelines will probably comment on standard 5.3.2 (the FERC asked for comments on whether they should adopt GISB's revisions).  They will also get with INGAA to begin coordination of INGAA's comments.\n",
      "I'll let you know what I hear from other pipelines or other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "GISB VERSION 1.5\n",
      "Assuming the FERC adopts the version 1.5 standards, the implementation date for the title transfer tracking (TTT) standards is April 18, 2002.  I'll work with the pipelines to ensure we're ready.  As I recall, we've been in compliance with the proposed standards for a while.  It would be a good idea to double check.\n",
      "The implementation date for the remainder of the standards could be as early as June 1, 2002.\n",
      "I'm working to determine the best way to update our copy of the version 1.5 standards to incorporate the corrections noted in the errata.  It is very unlikely that GISB will correct the standards books.  Other than the pipelines, none of the EC representatives have voiced a concern or an interest in having the books corrected.  It will be difficult for our people (business and technical) to use separate documents (the standards books and the errata) when implementing.  And, it will create greater opportunities for error.\n",
      "\n",
      "TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING\n",
      "I'm working with the IR chairs to finalize the data sets.  Next, Technical will develop code values to be used on our Web sites.  The data sets will then be sent to the EC for vote (EBB implementation only at this time) and will probably be included in version 1.6, scheduled for publication on July 31, 2002.  Technical will develop the EDI implementation guides, which will be part of a later publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS\n",
      "ENA has said that they will not continue to chair IR.  They may try to participate.  This leaves IR with only one chair.  Dale Davis and I are filling in the gap.  I'm not chairing any meetings -- I'm only helping outside the meetings.  We have a candidate in mind for IR chair and we're working to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible.  The current chair still is not working out, but the new chair should be able to handle the position and run IR.  The better job the IR chairs do, the less I have to do.\n",
      "We are also working on a few of IR's processes.  This will help to avoid another errata situation like the one we have with version 1.5.  The more complete IR's work product is, the less the NAESB office has to handle it and, therefore, the less they can mess it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "GISB PUBLICATION PROCESS\n",
      "The task force that is working on the publication process (PPRTF) is picking up speed again (after the holidays).  This group is addressing not only the publication process, but also the approval process for standards.  We meet via conference call every Tuesday and Friday for 1/2 day.  Our work product is due to the EC in time for their February 2002 meeting.  As with IR, the results should help avoid another massive errata, as we have for version 1.5.\n",

      "Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other majorenergy-trading companies.\n",
      "Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, with annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billion, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's traded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operation, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in transactions.\n",
      "\"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. \"There's not a trader out there that doesn't use EnronOnline.\" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid.\n",
      "Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may beintended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar with the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the faceof increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Streetanalysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions.\n",
      "While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well asthe company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. \"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.\n",
      "Enron said Mr. Fastow \"will be on a leave of absence from the company.\" He couldn't be reached for comment.\n",
      "It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. marketclose and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at nearly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-active stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stock.\n",
      "Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier this year, the stock was above $80 a share.\n",
      "In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, Dynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles.\n",
      "Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure couldbe seen as evidence that \"management does care\" about investor concerns. However, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming as it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as \"an admission of guilt.\" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron largely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financial structure.\n",
      "Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings.\n",
      "Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible \"death spiral\" in which increasing credit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any evidence of such a problem.\n",
      "However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information aboutits myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities. Enron is facing a problem with \"trust and credibility. It's not easy to regain something as basic as trust,\" he said.\n",

      "The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
      "''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clearto me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to havethe highest faith and confidence in Andy.''\n",
      "The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer.\n",
      "Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billionreduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billionwrite-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it.\n",
      "On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of thetransactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions.\n",
      "The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron'sdisclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand.\n",
      "By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equitythat had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address.\n",
      "Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses fromcomplicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either in cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate.\n",
      "Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.\n",
      "According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow'ssuccessor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.\n",
      "Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours trading, they fell to $16.14.\n",
      "One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. CarolCoale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Monday.\n",
      "''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yesterday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, asa gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is alittle late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People could fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get any answers.''\n",

      "Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle\n",
      "In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-based Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal securities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investment partnerships that he ran.\n",
      "Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow had been put on a \"leave of absence\" for an undetermined period and named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The company said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper.\n",
      "\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.\n",
      "Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quarter earnings on Oct 16.\n",
      "The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enron's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman andLJM2 Co-Investment.\n",
      "The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.\n",
      "But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.\n",
      "So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also ended its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enron took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2billion reduction in shareholder equity.\n",
      "Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protectedin dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a \"Chinese wall\" existed between Enron and LJM.\n",
      "Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer before moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up the company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahonasked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortable with the Fastow-LJM setup.\n",
      "Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available for comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receivinga salary.\n",
      "Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \"informal inquiry\" into the LJM dealings.\n",
      "The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling in August for personal reasons.\n",
      "A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followed the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.\n",
      "Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to giveanalysts enough data to make proper evaluations.\n",
      "Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partnerships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities.\n",
      "Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating maybe downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38.\n",
      "Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, which closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in someway end up harming the energy trading markets.\n",
      "A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with analysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, moved from a \"hold\" to a \"sell\" rating.\n",

      "Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.\n",
      "That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in thepartnerships established with Mr Fastow.\n",
      "Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
      "\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earlier served as Enron's treasurer.\n",
      "Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demonstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called for Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those calls.\n",
      "Ms Coale issued a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leadingto a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. \"We are concerned about what we don't know,\" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure.\n",

      "Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in its third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1.2bn equity charge related to the closing of \"related party transactions\" with two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention that the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest anyone?\n",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. Investors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so after its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposite effect.\n",
      "The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes receivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the terminationof previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. The uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stockto cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack of disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlikely to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for shareholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief executive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problemgoes beyond one individual.\n",

      "HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list investors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the company stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry.\n",
      "\"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC,\" Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. \"Who knows?\"\n",
      "Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Monday's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.\n",
      "\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closedWednesday.\n",
      "Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, who has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets group, takes over his role.\n",
      "\"I think change is good at this particular point in time,\" said FAC Equities analyst Robert Christensen said. \"I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered.\"A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more thanreplacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.\n",
      "\"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,\" Heim said.\n",
      "Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.\n",
      "\"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community,\" Heim said. \"Instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever.\"\n",
      "Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 per share, a 17 percent decline.\n",
      "Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.\n",
      "\"The market was asking for that to happen,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said of Fastow's departure. \"This is really the first time Enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis.\"\n",
      "Previously, Enron's managers have been \"cautious and defensive in their approach,\" he said.\n",
      "During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have since been dissolved.\n",
      "The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.\n",
      "\"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings orhere's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't everexpect to take any more charges,\" Heim said. \"What I heard is we don't have to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed.\"\n",
      "The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third quarter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's future, Heim said.\n",
      "\"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now, two years from now,\" he said.\n",
      "But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, Feygin said.\n",
      "Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.\n",
      "\"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (thepartnerships),\" Feygin said. \"Three days ago I would have said there is noneed for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was something Enron needed to do.\"\n",

      "Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chieffinancial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.\n",
      "After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conference call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at bythe Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasurer Jeff McMahon.\n",
      "The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. The stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion of shareholder wealth.\n",
      "\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.\n",
      "Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, resulting from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.\n",
      "The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equityfor the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related toa partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.\n",
      "In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently looking into the partnership arrangement.\n",
      "The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.\n",
      "During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary dutiesby allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.\n",
      "The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time thisweek, to \"sell\" from \"hold.\" Ms. Coale said the rating change is \"not because of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't know about the company.\"\n",
      "Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average daily volume is 6.7 million shares.\n",
      "J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron'sline during the conference call.\n",
      "The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder equity. But Mr. Feygin said management was \"defensive\" when pressed for details.\n",
      "Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more badnews was to come.\n",
      "While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the company's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term fortunes.\n",
      "Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's lowered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.\n",

      "Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with Andrew Fastow.\n",
      "The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the executive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this deal, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54% in just seven days.\n",
      "Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying thatonce-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.\n",
      "How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, toshow that the \"Fastow era\" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complainedabout Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2.\n",
      "Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.\n",
      "Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On adifficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company?\n",
      "The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday andWednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence.\n",
      "Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board.\n",
      "In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed the LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedgethat volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it hadnot thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.\n",
      "Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependenton potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency.\n",
      "Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?\n",

For a while, infact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues and blue chips, although there were moments when these stocks, too, slipped into negative territory. ?The day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and investors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not. ?Generally for small caps, \"It's `where do we go from here' time,\" said Andrew Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot of small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market reopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons to be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. \"Now, it seems the whole market islooking for direction.\" ?On the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, with 1.321 billion advancing and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced decliners by 1,902 to 1,628. ?It was tech all the way among the day's top performers. ?Communications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and networking firms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.2%, to 23.97, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Networks added 93 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17. ?Semiconductors were the session's second-best presenters with, among small caps, Elantec Semiconductor adding3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.80. ?Wireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-cap Nextel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after posting a third-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued firmness in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps,AirGate PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78. ?The day's poorest performers were natural-gas utilities, which continued to be dragged down by large cap Enron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedmont Natural Gas fell 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 30.63, and Peoples Energy shed 56 cents, or 1.4%, to 39.06. ?Pegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Cambridge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even stronger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estimate by 10 cents a share. ?Pinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. The Mountain View, Calif., video-production-system maker had a fiscal first-quarter loss of 11 cents a share before items, beating Wall Street expectations by eight cents a share. Thomas Weisel upgraded shares to `buy' from `market perform.' ?Sybase jumped 1.99, or 17%, to 13.50. The Emeryville, Calif., online-software developer reported 20 cents a share in earnings beforeitems, beating Wall Street's expectations by two cents a share. ?In a follow-on offering, AmeriPath gained 2.24, or 8.4%, to 29.04 after offering 4.125 million shares at $26 each. The follow-on, as is the custom, was priced at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80. ?Merger activity had a positive effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3.38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Billerica, Mass., semiconductor-equipment maker signed a definitive agreement to be bought by Brooks Automation for about $380 million in stock. Under the accord, which was approved by both companies' boards, PRI shareholders will receive 0.52 Brooks share for each PRI share held. Brooks Automation fell 1.31, 3.9%, to 31.80. ?Vysis surged 7.26, or 31%, to 30.26. The Downers Grove, Ill., genetic-disease researcher agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $30.50 a share, or $355 million. Abbott rose 38 cents to 54.24. ?ONI Systems dropped 1.01, or 15%, to 5.62.

All Rights Reserved.??WASHINGTON - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's co-founder said yesterday. ?In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.?\"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Ms. Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. ?Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. ?Only directors of U.S.companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. ?Ms. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. ?Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. ?\"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which representsAmerica's large pension funds. ?The corporate governance movement, since its beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examplesof lax board oversight still abound. ?One example would be Enron Corp., whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow said. ?\"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. Thatapparently didn't happen here.\" ?Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. ?\"This isn't just a corporategovernance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said. ?Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks.

The move follows Tuesday's conference call, which wasan attempt by Enron to restore investor confidence in the company.?\"Andy Fastow was a very well-regarded, low profile individual at Enron, and he's been unfairly pilloried in the press,\" said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. \"But the weight of circumstantial evidence and the material stock price decline made this inevitable.\"?Olson predicted theCFO swap would improve Enron's credibility with Wall Street.?A rough week?Enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved. ?Enron said Fastow had takena leave of absence and that McMahon, most recently chairman and CEO of theindustrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000, would take over.?\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clearto me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Lay, in a statement.?Karen Denne, a spokesperson for Enron, said numerous discussions Tuesday and Wednesday led to the decision. She said she did not know when Fastow would return. ?Shares of Enron fell more than 17 percent Wednesday to $16.41, then fell further in late trading following the announcement, to as low as $16.18. At one point during the trading day, the shares were trading at a six-year low of $15.51. ?Analysts deliver blows?Olson called Tuesday's conference call a \"missed opportunity,\" sayingEnron had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had become more \"forthright and open.\"?\"Unfortunately Enron is overloaded with lawyers,\" said Olson, who has not recommended the stock until recently. \"This company has been very much abused and maligned by people on Wall Street. They have some excellent businesses, and they have been carrying some losers.\"Enron has \"an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses, and excellent surplus cash flow,\" Olson said.?Enron expects to generate $3 billion of cash flow this year, and with $500 milliondevoted to dividends and $1 billion to maintenance capital spending, the company will have $1.5 billion free.?Several Wall Street firms cut their ratings on Enron shares Wednesday, including Prudential Securities. The firm advised clients to sell the stock, a rare recommendation. Prudential had rated the company's shares a \"hold.\" ?\"After much consideration, we are lowering our rating ... not because of things we know but because of things we potentially don't know about the company,\" wrote Prudential analyst Carol Coale in a note. ?On Monday, Enron announced that related-party transactions within the limited partnerships are under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Several shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed.?\"Management used the SEC inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the issue at hand, the LJM transactions,\" Coale said in reference to the conference call. ?Olson said it's unlikely that Enron, with its coterie of lawyers,would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles, but as to whetherit was \"right,\" he conceded it was probably not.?J.P.

The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. ?Fastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues because of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against the company. ?As recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a corporate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money machine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodities. ?But some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an Indian power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, andthen Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation.?There also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements had become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. ?Analysts said the replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but not a panacea for its credibility problems. ?\"The problems investors are having with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnership arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those concerns,\" said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. ?\"I don't think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these partnerships,\" he said. \"I still have a lot of questions.\" ?Andre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not that helpful. ?\"Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that clears up the picture,\" he said. \"Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have clean hands when it comes to these transactions.\" ?\"The fear driving the market is: if this is what we know, how much worse can it get?\" said J.P.

Closest was Dynegy Inc. which closed with a loss of $5.45, or 12.76 percent, at $37.26 - its lowest price in three weeks. ?POWER EARNINGS FORECASTS TRIMMED ?The talk of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and trading came from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - American Electric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. and PPL Corp. . ?Early Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, change in earnings per share next year from this year, citing expectations of lower profits on power sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The companyalso confirmed it still sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share. ?Noting PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia Securities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to \"market perform\" from \"strong buy\" explaining PPL's \"failure to differentiate itself from the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility. ?\"The company will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to be afforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks,\" heconcluded. ?Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar downgrades in Exelon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectations. ?STOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES ?\"The primary driver (for the 2002 estimate) is lower wholesale commodity price assumptions at (the company's generation unit), in addition to weaker distribution demand\" at Exelon's utility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chicago, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday. ?Exelon officials noted, in answer to analyst questions, that the view of 2002 demand had changed to negative from flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. ?The company's stock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the earnings release early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares continued to advance Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers among the 40 S&P Utility Index components. ?The big loser among the integrated utilities- those which produce and distribute power - was PPL, which ended the day at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 percent. ?Losses of about 1.3 percent were posted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, which slipped 52 cents to $39.48. ?AEP \"management cautioned that the slowingeconomy may make the upper end (of its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to $3.90) more difficult to achieve,\" Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrote in a note that maintained his estimate. ?He lowered his estimate of PSEG 2002 earnings per share 5 cents to $4.05 while awaiting the closing of a Peruvian purchase and pointed out it receives more for electricity than most PJM power producers because of restraints on the delivery of Midwest electricity to New Jersey's power hungry markets.??Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Fastow, 39 years old, ranLJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,?two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets.
